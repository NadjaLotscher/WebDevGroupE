          <h4>Game Process Flowchart</h4>
          <p>
            The game <strong>Apex Drifters</strong> offers a great gaming
            experience starting from the initial screen where players are
            prompted to enter their name and choose their vehicle. The core
            gameplay involves navigating the car through an endless track,
            dodging obstacles to survive, and collecting petrol to continue the
            journey. Making strategic choices, such as when to dodge obstacles,
            is vital, as collisions will result in a reduction of the fuel
            level. The goal is to keep the car running for as long as possible.
            Once the petrol runs out, the game ends, and the player's score is
            displayed on the scoreboard. Players can choose to restart the game
            to strive for a higher score.

            the decision points and consequences that the player faces
            throughout the game.
