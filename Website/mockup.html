            Let's start with the home page.
            We wanted an attractive homepage, so that the player would show an interest in playing our game. So we decided to use bright colors, maybe like a little bit "retro". 
            Therefore, the simplicity of the information will help the player not to get distracted and to be able to play without any difficulty.
          </p>
          <!-- Add your mockup content here -->
          <p>There is the mockup for our homepage. the cars and the speedometer immerse us directly into the world of our game. 
            The "Start" button will allow the user to move on to the next step.</p>
          <img src="../ressources/images/Mockup_HomePage.png">
          <p>On this page, you can choose any elements of your vehicle; the <strong>model</strong> of the car, his <strong>color</strong> and also his <strong>wheels</strong>. 
            The button "<i>start</i>" will start the game.</p>
          <img src="../ressources/images/Mockup_CarPersonalization.png">
          <p>You can see now the Board game. It is designed to remind the player of reality. His car is red and will be red <strong>all along</strong> the mockup. You can also see the <strong> scoreboard</strong> and the <strong>highscore</strong>.</p>
          <img src="../ressources/images/Mockup_BoardGame.png">
          <p>The picture represent our Game board with some of his obstacles, like other <strong>cars</strong> and <strong>barriers</strong>, 
            but also have the icon <strong>fuel</strong> so as not to break down.</p>
          <img src="../ressources/images/Mockup_BoardGame_withObstacles.png">
          <p>The last but not least, the end of the game. When you break down or you have hit too many objects, the game ended. 
            This will display a window with the score made, and a button to directly start a new game.</p>
